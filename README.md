# Healthcare-fraud-detection-using-spark-and-ML
Overview
This project leverages Apache Spark and Machine Learning (ML) to detect fraudulent healthcare claims. With the growing volume of healthcare data, fraud detection has become a critical challenge. This repository aims to address this issue by building scalable and efficient models to identify fraudulent activities in healthcare claims.

Features
Data Preprocessing with PySpark: Efficient handling of large datasets using Spark for distributed data processing.
Feature Engineering: Extraction and transformation of meaningful features to improve model performance.
Fraud Probability Estimation: Using linear regression for predicting the likelihood of fraudulent claims.
Fraud Classification: Employing Random Forest for binary classification of fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent claims.
Scalability: Built to handle large datasets, making it suitable for real-world healthcare applications.

Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Framework: Apache Spark (PySpark)
Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn, PySpark MLlib
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
